One mention of caution: Please don't use this without saving important work
first.  I have had two instances in which a GLUT/SDL instance crashed my X11
session.  It appears to happen very rarely, but no harm in being safe.

This is essentially useless without adding the GLUT or SDL packages!!! (The SDL
and GLUT packages include this package by default.)

This package is intended to be a fully fledged Julia (http://www.julialang.org)
interface to the OpenGL implementation on your machine.

Many OpenGL functions are working, but many (specifically those that expect
arrays) are still not fully implemented.  (You can edit the method signatures by
hand, but it is a painful process.  Jasper's FFI will soon handle this
automatically!)

#TODO

+ FFI a newer OpenGL spec
+ Fix any performance hiccups
+ Fix strange graphical issues (e.g., gllighting routines)

#Usage notes

PLEASE NOTE: When used in a Julia file, all of the function names are written
in lowercase. For example:

In C-OpenGL code, one would write,

```c
glBegin
glEnd
glVertex3f
```

In a Julia-OpenGL code, one would write:

```julia
glbegin
glend
glvertex
```

There are also some convienence functions, written by Jasper, that take
advantage of Julia's multiple dispatch.

glvertex takes Integer/Float scalars/vectors and calls the appopriate OpenGL
function.

glrotate, gltranslate, and glcolor act similarly.

At the moment, this has only been tested on a 2010 Macbook running Linux
(Fedora 17) and a custom built PC desktop running Linux (Fedora 17). Have fun!

#Loading and using images as textures

1. Load the image using imread from Julia's image.jl file. 
2. Pass the image array into glimg (automatically exported when
	 require("OpenGL") is evaluated). OpenGL expects upside-down, 1D image arrays
	 in a BGR format and glimg performs the necessary conversion on the 3D image
	 arrays produced by imread.
3. Initialize an empty array of Uint8's to contain texture identifiers.  For
	 example, an Array(Uint8,3) should be created if you want to make three
	 different textures.
4. Continue with the typical OpenGL image/texture process.  See Examples for 6,
	 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the GLUT and SDL packages for the relevant code.

#Credit

The VAST majority of work was done by Jasper den Ouden
(https://github.com/o-jasper).  Without his FFI, C header parser, original
examples, and responses to my questions, I would never have been able to put
this into a Julia package.  All credit goes to him.

We'd also like to thank the Khronos Group (http://www.opengl.org) for making the
OpenGL spec and hardware/software companies (open- and closed-source) for
adopting it. It has given countless amounts of people the freedom to make
beautiful graphics and visualize whatever they desire.

Thanks to NeHe Productions (http://nehe.gamedev.net) for making their excellent
tutorials, which served as a wonderful test-bed for this interface. 

Thanks to the Julia team (http://julialang.org) for making Julia, a programming
language that many have been longing for, whether they knew about it or not.
The "Octave-for-C-programmers," as one could think of it, is an incredibly fast
and powerful programming language that is a welcome breath of fresh air in the
technical and numerical programming communities.
